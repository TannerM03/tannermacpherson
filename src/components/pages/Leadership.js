        <p>Ambassador for Tech Start-Up</p>
        <p className = 'p2'>As an ambassador for FuzeMee, an app designed to help college students stay connected on campus, I leveraged my social media presence and passion for cutting-edge technology
         and played a pivotal role in boosting the company's visibility and user base. As an early adopter of the app, I provided valuable feedback during the testing phase, contributing to its refinement and success.

        <p>High School Student Body President</p>
        <p className = 'p2'>I've demonstrated organization skills by planning events including dances, festivals, and extracurricular activities. 
        Doing so, I collaborated closely with school administration and implemented positive changes within my school community. I rounded out my leadership abilities, strategic planning skills, and the ability to work productively with diverse peers. 
        I am now eager to leverage my proven leadership experience in a future professional role, where I can make a significant impact and drive success within an organization.</p>
        <p>Varsity Cross Country and Varsity Track and Field Captain</p>
        <p className = 'p2'>As Captain, I demonstrated strong leadership by coordinating team practices, strategizing race plans, and providing guidance and support to fellow athletes. I effectively communicated with coaches, ensuring seamless coordination of training schedules and competition logistics. 
        By setting a positive example through my own dedication and work ethic, I inspired team members to push their boundaries and strive for excellence.</p>
